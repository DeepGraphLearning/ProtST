1	FUNCTION: DNA ligase (ATP). DNA joinase. DNA repair enzyme. polydeoxyribonucleotide synthase (ATP). polynucleotide ligase (ATP). sealase.	FUNCTION: DNA ligase (ATP). DNA joinase. DNA repair enzyme. polydeoxyribonucleotide synthase (ATP). polynucleotide ligase (ATP). sealase. The enzyme catalyzes the ligation of DNA strands with 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate termini, forming a phosphodiester and sealing certain types of single-strand breaks in duplex DNA. Catalysis occurs by a three-step mechanism, starting with the activation of the enzyme by ATP, forming a phosphoramide bond between adenylate and a lysine residue. The adenylate group is then transferred to the 5'-phosphate terminus of the substrate, forming the capped structure 5'-(5'-diphosphoadenosine)-[DNA]. Finally, the enzyme catalyzes a nucleophilic attack of the 3'-OH terminus on the capped terminus, which results in formation of the phosphodiester bond and release of the adenylate. RNA can also act as substrate, to some extent. Cf. EC 6.5.1.2, EC 6.5.1.6 and EC 6.5.1.7.

The F-type enzymes of the inner mitochondrial and thylakoid membranes act as ATP synthases. All of the enzymes included here operate in a rotational mode, where the extramembrane sector (containing 3 alpha- and 3 beta-subunits) is connected via the delta-subunit to the membrane sector by several smaller subunits. Within this complex, the gamma- and epsilon-subunits, as well as the 9-12 c subunits rotate by consecutive 120 degree angles and perform parts of ATP synthesis. This movement is driven by the H(+) electrochemical potential gradient. The V-type (in vacuoles and clathrin-coated vesicles) and A-type (archaeal) enzymes have a similar structure but, under physiological conditions, they pump H(+) rather than synthesize ATP.

Dinitrogen reductase is a [4Fe-4S] protein, which, in the presence of two molecules of ATP, transfers an electron from ferredoxin to the dinitrogenase component. Dinitrogenase is a molybdenum-iron protein that reduces dinitrogen to two molecules of ammonia in three successive two-electron reductions via diazene and hydrazine. The reduction is initiated by formation of hydrogen in stoichiometric amounts. Acetylene is reduced to ethylene (but only very slowly to ethane), azide to nitrogen and ammonia, and cyanide to methane and ammonia. In the absence of a suitable substrate, hydrogen is slowly formed. Ferredoxin may be replaced by flavodoxin (see EC 1.19.6.1). The enzyme does not reduce CO (cf. EC 1.18.6.2). Formerly EC 1.18.2.1.

51	FUNCTION: peptidase Do. high temperature requirement protease A. HrtA heat shock protein. protease Do.	FUNCTION: peptidase Do. high temperature requirement protease A. HrtA heat shock protein. protease Do. This serine endopeptidase is essential for the clearance of denatured or aggregated proteins from the inner-membrane and periplasmic space in Escherichia coli. Natural substrates of the enzyme include colicin A lysis protein, pilin subunits and MalS from E.coli. The enzyme has weak peptidase activity with casein and other non- native substrates. The peptidase acts as a chaperone at low temperatures but switches to a peptidase (heat shock protein) at higher temperatures. Molecular chaperones and peptidases control the folded state of proteins by recognizing hydrophobic stretches of polypeptide that become exposed by misfolding or unfolding. They then bind these hydrophobic substrates to prevent aggregation or assist in protein refolding. If attempts at refolding fail, then irreversibly damaged proteins are degraded by peptidases such as this enzyme. Belongs to peptidase family S1B.

FUNCTION: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase. MAP3K. MAP kinase kinase kinase. MAPKKK. MEKK. MEK kinase. MLK-like mitogen-activated protein triple kinase. MLTK. This enzyme phosphorylates and activates its downstream protein kinase, EC 2.7.12.2, but requires MAPKKKK for activation. Some members of this family can be activated by p21-activated kinases (PAK/STE20) or Ras. While c-Raf and c-Mos activate the classical MAPK/ERK pathway, MEKK1 and MEKK2 preferentially activate the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase(JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are among the most widespread mechanisms of cellular regulation. Mammalian MAPK pathways can be recruited by a wide variety of stimuli including hormones (e.g. insulin and growth hormone), mitogens (e.g. epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor), vasoactive peptides (e.g. angiotensin-II and endothelin), inflammatory cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family and environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, ionizing radiation and ischemeic injury.

The reaction can be divided into three consecutive steps: Schiff base formation with pyruvate, the addition of L-aspartate-semialdehyde, and finally transimination leading to cyclization with simultaneous dissociation of the product. The product of the enzyme was initially thought to be (S)-2,3- dihydrodipicolinate, and the enzyme was classified accordingly as EC 4.2.1.52. Later studies of the enzyme from the bacterium Escherichia coli have suggested that the actual product of the enzyme is (2S,4S)-4-hydroxy- 2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate, and thus the enzyme has been reclassified as 4-hydroxy-tetrahydrodipicolinate synthase. However, the identity of the product is still controversial, as more recently it has been suggested that it may be (S)-2,3- dihydrodipicolinate after all. Formerly EC 4.2.1.52.

Unlike EC 2.3.2.26 the RING-E3 domain does not form a catalytic thioester intermediate with ubiquitin. Many members of the RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase family are not able to bind a substrate directly, and form a complex with a cullin scaffold protein and a substrate recognition module (the complexes are named CRL for Cullin-RING-Ligase). In these complexes, the RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase provides an additional function, mediating the transfer of a NEDD8 protein from a dedicated E2 carrier to the cullin protein (see EC 2.3.2.32).

In contrast to EC 2.3.1.41 and EC 2.3.1.179, this enzyme specifically uses short-chain acyl-CoA thioesters (preferably acetyl-CoA) rather than acyl-[acp] as its substrate. The enzyme can also catalyze the reaction of EC 2.3.1.38, but to a much lesser extent. The enzymes from some organisms (e.g. the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae) can accept branched-chain acyl-CoAs in addition to acetyl-CoA (cf. EC 2.3.1.300).

The enzyme is found in diverse organisms including animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. It hydrolyzes triglycerides into diglycerides and subsequently into monoglycerides and free fatty acids. The enzyme is highly soluble in water and acts at the surface of oil droplets. Access to the active site is controlled by the opening of a lid, which, when closed, hides the hydrophobic surface that surrounds the active site.

240	FUNCTION: caspase-3. apopain. CASP-3. CPP32. yama protein.	FUNCTION: caspase-3. apopain. CASP-3. CPP32. yama protein. Caspase-3 is an effector/executioner caspase, as are caspase-6 (EC 3.4.22.59) and caspase-7 (EC 3.4.22.60). These caspases are responsible for the proteolysis of the majority of cellular polypeptides, [e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)], which leads to the apoptotic phenotype. Procaspase-3 can be activated by caspase-1 (EC 3.4.22.36), caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.61), caspase-9 (EC 3.4.22.62) and caspase-10 (EC 3.4.22.63) as well as by the serine protease granzyme B. Caspase-3 can activate procaspase-2 (EC 3.4.22.55). Activation occurs by inter-domain cleavage followed by removal of the N-terminal prodomain. While Asp-Glu-(Val/Ile)-Asp is thought to be the preferred cleavage sequence, the enzyme can accommodate different residues at P2 and P3 of the substrate. Like caspase-2, a hydrophobic residue at P5 of caspase-3 leads to more efficient hydrolysis, e.g. (Val/Leu)-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-|- is a better substrate than Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-|-. This is not the case for caspase-7. Belongs to peptidase family C14.

NO synthase. The enzyme consists of linked oxygenase and reductase domains. The eukaryotic enzyme binds FAD, FMN, heme (iron protoporphyrin IX) and tetrahydrobiopterin, and its two domains are linked via a regulatory calmodulin-binding domain. Upon calcium-induced calmodulin binding, the reductase and oxygenase domains form a complex, allowing electrons to flow from NADPH via FAD and FMN to the active center. The reductase domain of the enzyme from the bacterium Sorangium cellulosum utilizes a [2Fe-2S] cluster to transfer the electrons from NADPH to the active center. Cf. EC 1.14.14.47.
243	FUNCTION: DNA helicase. 	FUNCTION: DNA helicase.  DNA helicases utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind double-stranded DNA.

The enzyme binds to chitin and randomly cleaves glycosidic linkages in chitin and chitodextrins in a non-processive mode, generating chitooligosaccharides and free ends on which exo-chitinases and exo- chitodextrinases can act. Activity is greatly stimulated in the presence of EC 1.14.99.53, which attacks the crystalline structure of chitin and makes the polymer more accesible to the chitinase. Cf. EC 3.2.1.202.

FUNCTION: nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase. niacin ribonucleotidase. nicotinic acid mononucleotide glycohydrolase. nicotinic acid mononucleotide pyrophosphorylase. nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase. The enzyme, which is involved in pyridine nucleotide recycling, can form beta-nicotinate D-ribonucleotide and diphosphate from nicotinate and 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) in the absence of ATP. However, when ATP is available the enzyme is phosphorylated resulting in a much lower Km for nicotinate. The phospho-enzyme is hydrolyzed during the transferase reaction, regenerating the low affinity form. The presence of ATP shifts the products/substrates equilibrium from 0.67 to 1100. Formerly EC 2.4.2.11.

FUNCTION: succinate dehydrogenase. fumarate reductase (menaquinone). succinate dehydrogenase (menaquinone). succinate dehydrogenase (quinone). succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone). succinic dehydrogenase. A complex generally comprising an FAD-containing component that also binds the carboxylate substrate (A subunit), a component that contains three different iron-sulfur centers [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], and [3Fe-4S] (B subunit), and a hydrophobic membrane-anchor component (C, or C and D subunits) that is also the site of the interaction with quinones. The enzyme is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of bacteria and archaea, with the hydrophilic domain extending into the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm, respectively. Under aerobic conditions the enzyme catalyzes succinate oxidation, a key step in the citric acid (TCA) cycle, transferring the electrons to quinones in the membrane, thus linking the TCA cycle with the aerobic respiratory chain (where it is known as complex II). Under anaerobic conditions the enzyme functions as a fumarate reductase, transferring electrons from the quinol pool to fumarate, and participating in anaerobic respiration with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. The enzyme interacts with the quinone produced by the organism, such as ubiquinone, menaquinone, caldariellaquinone, thermoplasmaquinone, rhodoquinone etc. Some of the enzymes contain two heme subunits in their membrane anchor subunit. These enzymes catalyze an electrogenic reaction and are thus classified as EC 7.1.1.12.

Phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and threonine residues in the activation loop of this enzyme by EC 2.7.12.2 is necessary for enzyme activation. Once activated, the enzyme phosphorylates target substrates on serine or threonine residues followed by a proline. A distinguishing feature of all MAPKs is the conserved sequence Thr- Xaa-Tyr (TXY). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are among the most widespread mechanisms of cellular regulation. Mammalian MAPK pathways can be recruited by a wide variety of stimuli including hormones (e.g. insulin and growth hormone), mitogens (e.g. epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor), vasoactive peptides (e.g. angiotensin-II and endothelin), inflammatory cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family and environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, ionizing radiation and ischemeic injury.

Escherichia coli mutants that lack this enzyme are deficient in unsaturated fatty acids. Can use fatty acyl thioesters of ACP (C2 to C16) as substrates, as well as fatty acyl thioesters of Co-A (C4 to C16). The substrate specificity is very similar to that of EC 2.3.1.179 with the exception that the latter enzyme is far more active with palmitoleoyl-ACP (C16Delta(9)) as substrate, allowing the organism to regulate its fatty-acid composition with changes in temperature.

Alternatively, the enzymes act on the Man8GlcNAc2 isomer formed by EC 3.2.1.209. The enzymes are type II membrane proteins, require Ca(2+), and use an inverting mechanism. While all three human enzymes can catalyze the reactions listed here, some of the enzymes can additionally catalyze hydrolysis in an alternative order, generating additional isomeric intermediates, although the final product is the same. The names of the isomers listed here are based on a nomenclature system proposed by Prien et al.
258	FUNCTION: RBR-type E3 ubiquitin transferase. 	FUNCTION: RBR-type E3 ubiquitin transferase.  RBR-type E3 ubiquitin transferases have two RING fingers separated by an internal motif (IBR, for In Between RING). The enzyme interacts with the CRL (Cullin-RING ubiquitin Ligase) complexes formed by certain RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase (see EC 2.3.2.27), which include a neddylated cullin scaffold protein and a substrate recognition module. The RING1 domain binds an EC 2.3.2.23, and transfers the ubiquitin that is bound to it to an internal cysteine residue in the RING2 domain, followed by the transfer of the ubiquitin from RING2 to the substrate. Once the substrate has been ubiquitinated by the RBR-type ligase, it can be ubiqutylated further using ubiquitin carried directly on E2 enzymes, in a reaction catalyzed by EC 2.3.2.27. Activity of the RBR-type enzyme is dependent on neddylation of the cullin protein in the CRL complex. Cf. EC 2.3.2.26, EC 2.3.2.27, and EC 2.3.2.32.

FUNCTION: tyrosinase. cresolase. monophenol monooxygenase. monophenol oxidase. N-acetyl-6-hydroxytryptophan oxidase. phenolase. tyrosine-dopa oxidase. Found in a broad variety of bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, crustaceans, and mammals, which is involved in the synthesis of betalains and melanin. The enzyme, which is activated upon binding molecular oxygen, can catalyze both a monophenolase reaction cycle or a diphenolase reaction cycle. During the monophenolase cycle, one of the bound oxygen atoms is transferred to a monophenol (such as L-tyrosine), generating an O-diphenol intermediate, which is subsequently oxidized to an o-quinone and released, along with a water molecule. The enzyme remains in an inactive deoxy state, and is restored to the active oxy state by the binding of a new oxygen molecule. During the diphenolase cycle the enzyme binds an external diphenol molecule (such as L-dopa) and oxidizes it to an O-quinone that is released along with a water molecule, leaving the enzyme in the intermediate met state. The enzyme then binds a second diphenol molecule and repeats the process, ending in a deoxy state. The second reaction is identical to that catalyzed by the related enzyme catechol oxidase (EC 1.10.3.1). However, the latter can not catalyze the hydroxylation or monooxygenation of monophenols.

The reaction occurs in the reverse direction to that shown above. Exhibits high specificity for the reduction of the S-form of L-methionine S-oxide, acting faster on the residue in a peptide than on the free amino acid.

Brings about the chlorination of a range of organic molecules, forming stable C-Cl bonds. Also oxidizes bromide and iodide. Enzymes of this type are either heme-thiolate proteins, or contain vanadate. A secreted enzyme produced by the ascomycetous fungus Caldariomyces fumago (Leptoxyphium fumago) is an example of the heme-thiolate type. It catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid by transferring one oxygen atom from H2O2 to chloride. At a separate site it catalyzes the chlorination of activated aliphatic and aromatic substrates, via HClO and derived chlorine species. In the absence of halides, it shows peroxidase (e.g. phenol oxidation) and peroxygenase activities. The latter inserts oxygen from H2O2 into, for example, styrene (side chain epoxidation) and toluene (benzylic hydroxylation), however, these activities are less pronounced than its activity with halides. Has little activity with non-activated substrates such as aromatic rings, ethers or saturated alkanes. The chlorinating peroxidase produced by ascomycetous fungi (e.g. Curvularia inaequalis) is an example of a vanadium chloroperoxidase, and is related to bromide peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.18). It contains vanadate and oxidizes chloride, bromide and iodide into hypohalous acids.

301	FUNCTION: ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase. ribonucleotide reductase.	FUNCTION: ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase. ribonucleotide reductase. This enzyme is responsible for the de novo conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, which are essential for DNA synthesis and repair. There are three types of this enzyme differing in their cofactors. Class Ia enzymes contain a diiron(III)-tyrosyl radical, class Ib enzymes contain a dimanganese-tyrosyl radical, and class II enzymes contain adenosylcobalamin. In all cases the cofactors are involved in generation of a transient thiyl (sulfanyl) radical on a cysteine residue, which attacks the substrate, forming a ribonucleotide 3'-radical, followed by water loss to form a ketyl (alpha-oxoalkyl) radical. The ketyl radical is reduced to 3'-keto-deoxynucleotide concomitant with formation of a disulfide anion radical between two cysteine residues. A proton-coupled electron-transfer from the disulfide radical to the substrate generates a 3'-deoxynucleotide radical, and the the final product is formed when the hydrogen atom that was initially removed from the 3'-position of the nucleotide by the thiyl radical is returned to the same position. The disulfide bridge is reduced by the action of thioredoxin. Cf. EC 1.1.98.6 and EC 1.17.4.2.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are among the most widespread mechanisms of cellular regulation. Mammalian MAPK pathways can be recruited by a wide variety of stimuli including hormones (e.g. insulin and growth hormone), mitogens (e.g. epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor), vasoactive peptides (e.g. angiotensin-II and endothelin), inflammatory cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family and environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, ionizing radiation and ischemeic injury.

322	FUNCTION: corrinoid adenosyltransferase. aquacob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. aquocob(I)alamin vitamin B12s adenosyltransferase. ATP:cob(I)alamin Cobeta-adenosyltransferase.

FUNCTION: corrinoid adenosyltransferase. aquacob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. aquocob(I)alamin vitamin B12s adenosyltransferase. ATP:cob(I)alamin Cobeta-adenosyltransferase. ATP:corrinoid adenosyltransferase. cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. cob(I)yrinic acid a,c-diamide adenosyltransferase. The corrinoid adenosylation pathway comprises three steps: (i) reduction of Co(III) to Co(II) by a one-electron transfer. This can occur non-enzymically in the presence of dihydroflavin nucleotides or reduced flavoproteins. (ii) Co(II) is bound by corrinoid adenosyltransferase, resulting in displacement of the lower axial ligand by an aromatic residue. The reduction potential of the 4-coordinate Co(II) intermediate is raised by ~250 mV compared with the free compound, bringing it to within physiological range. This is followed by a second single-electron transfer from either free dihydroflavins or the reduced flavin cofactor of flavoproteins, resulting in reduction to Co(I). (iii) the Co(I) conducts a nucleophilic attack on the adenosyl moiety of ATP, resulting in transfer of the deoxyadenosyl group and oxidation of the cobalt atom to Co(III) state. Three types of corrinoid adenosyltransferases, not related by sequence, have been described. In the anaerobic bacterium Salmonella enterica they are encoded by the cobA gene (a housekeeping enzyme involved in both adenosylcobalamin de novo biosynthesis and salvage), the pduO gene (involved in (S)-propane-1,2-diol utilization), and the eutT gene (involved in ethanolamine utilization). Since EutT hydrolyzes triphosphate during catalysis, it is classified as a separate enzyme. The mammalian enzyme belongs to the PduO type. The enzyme can act on other corrinoids, such as cob(II)inamide. Formerly EC 1.16.8.1.
